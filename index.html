												From our inception, <strong>we’ve been part of the fabric of the economy of the Berkshires</strong>. In addition to the tourism our programming has brought to the community, we have a history of employing local staff and artists, providing income to local businesses involved in supporting our festival, and generating revenue from ticket sales and sponsorships.
											</p>
											<p>
												Our cultural influence on the local community has also been significant. We’ve made the Berkshires a destination for theatergoing, for audiences and artists alike. As recently as July 2023, a critic from the NY Times wrote: “Over a couple of days in Western Massachusetts last week, I saw two plays, one play reading and one cabaret, and <strong>if you looked at the quality of what was there — rather than the quantity of what was not — you’d hardly know that anything was amiss</strong>.”

So I joined last year, and it was a lot of experimentation, and it was a lot of newness that I thrived off of. This year there was even more changes, and I felt like my time was not done.

												<p>“What makes the Williamstown Theatre Festival special is the combination of people who are learning craft for the first time, coming together with people who are experienced in their craft and who want to try new challenges. I think that's the thing that makes this place distinctive more so than other theaters where you could just put on plays. I think it's the combination of that energy plus this incredibly beautiful, magical location, which is Williamstown, Massachusetts, and the Berkshire Hills that really come together to create something very, very special. I mean, I've always felt that.”</p>

People visit, in part, to get distance on their lives, ponder and consider new pathways. WTF synergistically complements those dynamics for audiences and artists by creating its own beauty, and by boldly provoking larger questions. In this way the WTF and the Berkshires symbiotically reinforce a journey of reinvigoration and beauty.”</p>

More unexpected are studies by Weinstein and others that associate screen time with loss of empathy and lack of altruism. And the risks are even higher than depression and isolation. In a 2011 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, time in front of a screen was associated with a higher risk of death, and that was independent of physical activity.”

											<p>
												What has happened for 70 summers in Williamstown is hard to describe to those who have not been. It’s a coming together of people and place, talent and town, star power and service to the craft. It is alchemy.
											</p>
											<p>
												But, the American theatre is in peril. The pandemic decimated  our audiences. A global racial reckoning surfaced our industry’s exclusivity and bias. A national labor reckoning challenged our way of working. Funding, as part of a sector-wide drought, is scarce. And the American theatre doesn’t hold the same cultural relevance and impact as it did 70 years ago. 
											</p>
											<p>
												As our screens distance us further from a tangible reality, gathering becomes an increasingly radical act. Theatre is gathering—a shared communal experience that sparks understanding, connection, joy, and discovery. And so, theatre can heal, help us cope, and help us live longer, better lives. Theatre creates the conditions for personal and societal transformation.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div>
											<p>
												In a rapidly changing world, our industry is being called to respond to our challenges with innovation, breaking new ground, and inventing different ways forward. Pushing our time-tested form to tackle current realities of our society: widespread isolation, disconnection from nature, ideological division and social disparity. A better future depends on it.
											</p>
											<p>
												Williamstown Theatre Festival is a place of connection for people—to one another, to nature, to difference, to diversity, to culture, to theatre. 
											</p>
											<p>
												We craft transportive experiences for audiences. We cultivate  new ways of working and learning for artists. We nurture the local community that nurtures us, lifting the region of the Berkshires, its environment and its local economy. We build bridges of access to the American theatre through our platforms. We shape generations of theatre-makers and theatre-goers. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Williamstown Theatre Festival brings us together and transforms us. Because there’s nothing else like it when WTF is happening.
